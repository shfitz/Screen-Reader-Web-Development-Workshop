    <h1>Hello HTML</h1>
    <h2>Why can code be so difficult?</h2>
        <p>Computers need exact instructions. Code languages are just like a recipe, or set of instructions. If your computer doesn’t understand something because of a typo or incorrect use of code, it can’t do what you wish. If you do not understand something, you can always ask someone, but computers are less forgiving.</p>

    <h2>The index page</h2>
    <p>Websites have a special file for the first page you come to on a site. When you visit google.com or yahoo.com, or any domain at all, you're actually accessing a file named <em>index.html</em>.</p>
    <p>We'll make this index page in a few minutes, but first let's look at the structure of HTML, the markup language we'll be using.</p>
    <h2>HTML structure</h2>
    <p>HTML defines the structure of your webpages. The language contains <em>elements</em> that are typically comprised of two <em>tags</em>. One opening tag and one closing tag. Each HTML element tells the browser something about the information that is inside two tags.
        
        As we mentioned earlier, it's useful to think of HTML as the bones of your site. Just like you, HTML contains a head and a body.</p><p>Tags are like containers for content. They surround the things they describe.</p> <p><a href="01a_example_HTML.html">here is a small sample of HTML</a></p>
